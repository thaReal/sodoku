The Tonyoku Sodoku Solver
=========================

A python based sodoku solver. Currently in development, but is semi-functional.
Currently, the GUI needs a good amount of tidying and the debug output (printed
to stdout for now) could be re-written to give much more useful data about the
puzzle in progress.

The next steps before a complete code scrub are adding some of the easier to 
implement features into the program as well as updating the documentation 
and building at least some simple, boilerplate tests.
